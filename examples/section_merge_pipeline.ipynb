If the two sections should be combined into one, return 'Yes'; if not, return 'No' based on the linguistic flow, content and section headers (if available). Section 1: money, Lessor will accept payments of rent from such Leasehold Mortgagee and this Agreement will not terminate, but will remain in full force and effect, pending Leasehold Mortgagee's cure of such default within the time periods described herein or resort to foreclosure or sale proceedings under its deed of trust or other security instruments. 2.18.4 If any default has been cured by a Leasehold Mortgagee or Assignee, Lessor agrees that upon completion of any foreclosure proceedings or sale under the deed of trust or other security instrument securing the loan, or upon delivery of a deed in lieu of foreclosure, the Leasehold Mortgagee or purchaser at such sale or any heir, successor, or assign of Leasehold Mortgagee (Assignee) subsequent to such sale will be recognized by Lessor as the lessee under the terms of this Agreement for all purposes for the remaining term hereof. The leasehold interest of the Leasehold Mortgagee or such Assignee will not be adversely affected or terminated by reason of any nonmonetary default occurring prior to the completion of such proceedings or sale, provided such default has been promptly remedied (to the extent it is capable of being remedied by Leasehold Mortgagee), or if such default requires possession to cure, provided such Leasehold Mortgagee, Assignee or purchaser promptly commences to cure upon taking possession of the Premises. 2.18.5 Such Leasehold Mortgagee will not become personally liable under the terms and obligations of this Agreement unless and until it assumes the obligations and is recognized by Lessor as lessee under this Agreement and will be liable only so long as such Leasehold Mortgagee or Assignee maintains ownership of the leasehold interest or estate and recourse to such Leasehold Mortgagee or Assignee shall be limited solely to Leasehold Mortgagee's or Assignee's interest in the Premises. 2.18.6 At any time during the term of this Lease, within ten (10) days after a written request by the Company or any Leasehold Mortgagee, Lessor, through Lessor's Designated Representative, will execute, acknowledge and deliver to the Company or such person or entity as the Company designates, a certificate stating: (a) that this Agreement is the only Agreement between Lessor and Company concerning the Premises and is unmodified and in full force and effect in accordance with its terms (or if there have been modifications, that this Agreement is in force and effect as modified, and identifying the modification agreements, or if this Agreement is not in full force and effect, that it is not); (b) the commencement and expiration dates of this Agreement and the date to which rental has been paid to Lessor under this Agreement; (c) whether or not, to the knowledge of the Lessor, there is an existing default by Company in the payment of Rent or any other sum of money under this Agreement, and whether or not there is any other existing default by either party under this Agreement with respect to which a notice of default has been served, and if there is such a default specifying its nature and extent; (d) whether or not, to the knowledge of Lessor, there are any set-offs, defenses or counter-claims against enforcement of the obligations to be performed by Lessor or Company under this Agreement; and, (e) such other reasonable information relating to this Agreement that a Leasehold Mortgagee or assignee may request. 2.18.7 All notices of default required to be delivered to a Leasehold Mortgagee under this Agreement will be sent to any Leasehold Mortgagee by overnight courier service or certified mail, return receipt requested. No such notice shall be valid or effective as against the Leasehold Mortgagee until and unless actually received by the Leasehold Mortgagee as evidenced by the courier service's delivery records or the return receipt. 2.18.8 In the event this Agreement is terminated for any reason prior to the end of the term (it being the intent that the Agreement will remain in full force and effect if Leasehold Mortgagee performs), Lessor shall enter into a new Agreement with Leasehold Mortgagee holding a first priority interest covering the Premises, provided that the Leasehold Mortgagee (i) requests such new Agreement by written notice to Lessor within sixty (60) days after termination, and (ii) cures all prior defaults of Company that are capable of being cured by Leasehold Mortgagee. The new Agreement shall be for the remainder of the term, effective at the date of such termination, at the same rent and on the same covenants, agreements, conditions, provisions, restrictions and limitations IBC Bldg. 1 Ground Lease 21 1112021 contained in this Agreement. The new Agreement shall have the same title priority as this Agreement and shall be subject only to the exceptions to title having priority over this Agreement or such additional exceptions to which such Leasehold Mortgagee has consented in writing. In the event the Lessor and such Leasehold Mortgagee enter into any such new Agreement, title to all the Facilities located upon the Premises as of the date of such new Agreement shall automatically vest in such Leasehold Mortgagee. If requested by such Leasehold Mortgagee, Lessor agrees to execute and deliver to Leasehold Mortgagee within 10 days after request therefore, a quitclaim deed in recordable form conveying title to such Facilities to such Leasehold Mortgagee. Lessor also agrees to assign to such Leasehold Mortgagee all Subleases with Tenants who's Subleases attorn to Lessor upon the termination of this Agreement. 2.18.9 Lessor shall cooperate in amending this Agreement from time to time to add any provision which may reasonably be requested by any Leasehold Mortgagee or proposed lender for the purpose of implementing the mortgagee protection provisions contained in this Agreement and allowing such Leasehold Mortgagee reasonable means to protect or preserve the lien of its loan and the value of its security. Lessor agrees to execute and deliver (and to acknowledge if necessary for recording purposes) any agreement necessary to effect any such amendment; provided, however, that any such amendment shall not in any way affect or change the term of this Agreement or the Rent or other amounts payable to Lessor under this Agreement, subordinate the fee interest of Lessor in the real property underlying the Premises, nor otherwise in any material respect adversely affect any rights of Lessor under this Agreement. 2.18.10 The bankruptcy or insolvency of Company will not operate or permit the Lessor to terminate this Agreement as long as all Rent or other monetary payments required to be paid by Company continue to be paid and other required obligations are performed in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. 2.18.11 To the extent any of the terms of this Agreement are inconsistent with the terms of this Section regarding mortgagee protection provisions, the mortgagee protection provisions will control. 2.18.12 Every Leasehold Mortgage shall contain a provision that copies of all notices of default by Company thereunder must be sent to Lessor. In the event of any default by Company under any Leasehold Mortgage, the Lessor reserves the right to make any payments due to the Leasehold Mortgagee before the Leasehold Mortgagee resorts to any foreclosure or sale proceedings under its deed of trust or other security instrument. 2.18.12.1 Following any foreclosure or deed in lieu of foreclosure the leasehold estate created by this Agreement and the Facilities may be transferred or assigned as provided in Section 2.1.2. 2.18.13 Any mortgage placed by the Lessor on the fee title to the Premises shall be subordinate to this Agreement (and any replacement to this Agreement), any separate lease entered into in accordance with Section 4.8 and all Subleases. 2.18.14 Prior to any termination of this Agreement by Lessor, any Leasehold Mortgagee shall be allowed sufficient time to complete any foreclosure action, including time for delays due to official restraint (including by law, process or injunction issued by a court), so long as such Leasehold Mortgagee is making payments required by this Agreement which can be reasonably determined prior to acquiring the Company's interest under this Agreement. Leasehold Mortgagee shall have the right to terminate foreclosure proceedings at any time if Company has cured all defaults under any loan from Leasehold Mortgagee. However, no such termination of foreclosure proceedings shall prevent Lessor from pursuing, or continuing to pursue, its rights and remedies under this Agreement against Company for any uncured defaults under this Agreement. 2.18.15 So long as any Leasehold Mortgage is in effect, there shall be no merger of the leasehold estate created by this Agreement into the fee simple estate in the Premises without the prior written consent of the Leasehold Mortgagee. 2.18.16 Any Leasehold Mortgagee shall have the right to participate in any settlement or adjustment of losses under insurance policies maintained by Company under this Agreement. Such Leasehold Mortgagee shall be named as a loss payee or additional insured, as applicable, in accordance with any loan documents executed by Company, under the insurance policies required under this Agreement. Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain provisions in Leasehold Mortgages providing IBC Bldg. 1 Ground Lease 22 1112021 Section 2: that any proceeds of insurance shall first be used for the purposes provided for in this Agreement before any portion thereof is applied to repay any indebtedness under such Leasehold Mortgage.\n",
      "Reasoning: Let's think step by step in order to determine if these two sections should be combined. The first section discusses the rights and obligations of the Leasehold Mortgagee in relation to defaults, foreclosure, and the continuation of the lease agreement. It outlines the conditions under which the Leasehold Mortgagee can cure defaults, the recognition of the Leasehold Mortgagee as the lessee, and the procedures for notices and agreements related to the lease. The second section continues this discussion, detailing the protections for the Leasehold Mortgagee, including their rights in the event of a default by the Company, the subordination of any mortgages placed by the Lessor, and the conditions under which the leasehold estate can be transferred or assigned.

The Lease Term shall also include any properly exercised renewal or extension of the term of this Lease. Lease Year shall mean a period of twelve (12) consecutive months commencing on the Lease Commencement Date (plus the partial month in which the Lease Commencement Date occurs if the Lease Commencement Date is not the first day of a month) and each successive twelve (12) month period thereafter. 2 2.2 The Work shall be deemed to be substantially complete when the work and materials to be provided by Landlord pursuant to Exhibit B attached hereto (except for items of work and adjustment of equipment and fixtures that can be completed after the Premises are occupied without causing substantial interference with Tenant's use of the Premises (i.e., the \"punch list\" items)) have been completed, as determined by Landlord. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, if Landlord shall be delayed in completing the work and materials to be provided pursuant to Exhibit B as a direct or indirect result of (1) Tenant's failure to comply with any of its duties and obligations hereunder or with any deadlines specified in Exhibit B, (2) Tenant's request for modifications to plans or working drawings subsequent to the date such plans or working drawings are approved by Tenant, (3) Tenant's failure to pay when due any amount required pursuant to Exhibit B, (4) Tenant's request for materials, finishes or installations not deemed by Landlord to be building standard materials, finishes or installations, (5) any change orders requested by Tenant, or (6) the performance of any work by any person or firm employed or retained by Tenant, then for purposes of determining the Lease Commencement Date, the work and materials to be provided pursuant to Exhibit B shall be deemed to have been substantially complete on the date that Landlord determines that such work and materials would have been substantially complete if such delay(s) had not occurred. 2.3 It is presently anticipated that the Premises will be delivered to Tenant within approximately three (3) from the date of execution of this Lease. If Landlord does not complete construction and deliver possession of the Premises by such date, then Landlord shall not have any liability whatsoever, and this Lease shall not be rendered voidable on account thereof. [Delete Section 2.4 if the deal does not include renewal options.] 2.4 Landlord hereby grants to Tenant the conditional right, exercisable at Tenant's option, to renew the term of this Lease for () term(s) of ten (10) years. If exercised, and if the conditions applicable thereto have been satisfied, the Renewal Term ([each, a] the \"Renewal Term\") shall commence immediately following the end of the then-current Lease Term. The right of renewal herein granted to Tenant shall be subject to, and shall be exercised in accordance with, the following terms and conditions: (a) Tenant shall exercise its right of renewal with respect to the applicable Renewal Term by giving Landlord written notice thereof not later than six (6) months prior to the expiration of the then-current Lease Term ([each, a]the \"Renewal Notice\"). During the Renewal Term, all terms and conditions of this Lease shall remain the same, except that the annual Base Rent payable for the first Lease Year of the Renewal Term and each Lease Year thereafter shall be as set forth in Section 3.1 below. If Tenant timely and validly exercises its right of renewal, then, at Landlord's option, Landlord and Tenant shall promptly enter into an amendment to this Lease reflecting the terms described above. (b) If the Renewal Notice is not given timely, then Tenant's right of renewal pursuant to this Section shall lapse and be of no further force of effect. (c) If Tenant is in default under this Lease on the date that the Renewal Notice is given to Landlord or at any time prior to the commencement of the Renewal Term, then, at Landlord's option, the Renewal Term shall not commence and the term of the Lease shall expire at the expiration date of the term of this Lease. 3 (d) If at any time this Lease has been assigned or any portion of the Premises has been subleased, then Tenant's rights pursuant to this Section shall lapse and be of no further force or effect. (e) Tenant's right of renewal under this Section may be exercised by Tenant only and may not be exercised by any transferee, sublessee or assignee of Tenant. Section 2: SECTION 3 RENT 3.1 Tenant shall pay to Landlord, during the term of this Lease, and any renewal thereof, in lawful money of the United States, without any prior demand and without any setoff or deduction whatsoever, base rent (\"Base Rent\") as follows: a) Commencing on the Commencement Date, or on such earlier date that Tenant enters into possession of the Premises for the purpose of conducting its business therein, Tenant shall pay Base Rent to Landlord the amount of $37,800.00 per year, payable in advance, in equal monthly installments of $3150. [Commencing on the first day of the second Lease Year and on the first day of each Lease Year thereafter, the Base Rent shall be increased to an amount equal to one hundred and three percent (103%) of the Base Rent payable in the preceding Lease Year and the Base Rent shall continue to be payable in monthly installments.] [Delete Section 3.1(b) if the deal does not include renewal options.] b) If Tenant exercises its option to renew the term of this Lease, then the annual Base Rent shall continue to increase as of the first day of each Lease Year of the Renewal Term in an amount equal to one hundred one hundred and three percent (103%) of the annual Base Rent payable in the preceding Lease Year and the annual Base Rent shall continue to be payable in monthly installments in advance. 3.2 On the first day of each and every month during the term of this Lease, Tenant covenants and agrees to pay to Landlord an amount equal to the sum of the monthly installments of rent set forth herein plus the monthly installments of additional rent set forth in this Lease. 3.3 Tenant covenants and agrees to pay the rent set forth herein to the Landlord at its offices described above or at such other place as the Landlord may from time to time designate by written notice to Tenant. Landlord's acceptance of rent after it shall have become due and payable shall not excuse a delay upon subsequent occasions nor constitute a waiver of rights, notwithstanding any endorsement or restriction that Tenant may include with such payment. If Tenant shall have been late in the payment of any installment of rent or if any payment of rent by check has been returned for insufficient funds or if tenant otherwise defaults under this Lease, Landlord may at any time thereafter require that all payments of rent and additional rent due hereunder be paid by certified check. 3.4 Tenant agrees to pay a \"late charge\" equal to five (5%) per cent of the payment due, for any payment of rent or additional rent not received by Landlord by the fifth (5th) day of the 4 month due. Such payment and such late fee shall bear interest at the rate of eighteen percent (18%) per annum (the \"Default Rate\") from the date such payment was due to the date of payment.\n",

The Landlord, Property Manager and the Tenant and all parties claiming under them hereby mutually release and discharge each other from all claims and liabilities arising from or covered by insurance on the Premises or covered by insurance in connection with property on or activities conducted on the Premises regardless of the cause of the damage or loss. Each party shall secure from its insurer proof that its respective insurer honors this provision.\n",
      "Reasoning: Let's think step by step in order to\u001b[32m determine if these two sections should be combined. The first section discusses the insurance requirements and responsibilities of the Tenant and Landlord, detailing the types of insurance to be maintained, coverage amounts, and the obligations of the Tenant regarding insurance certificates. The second section addresses the waiver of subrogation rights, which is a separate but related topic concerning the release of claims between the parties regarding insured losses. While both sections pertain to insurance, they cover different aspects: one focuses on the insurance obligations and the other on the waiver of claims. Therefore, they should not be combined as they serve distinct purposes within the agreement.\n",
