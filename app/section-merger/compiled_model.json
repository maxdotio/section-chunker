Landlord's exercise of any such right or remedy shall not\nprevent the concurrent or subsequent exercise of any other right or remedy. Landlord's delay or\nfailure to exercise or enforce any of Landlord's rights or remedies or Tenant's obligations shall not\nconstitute a waiver of any such rights, remedies or obligations. Landlord shall not be deemed to\nhave waived any default unless such waiver expressly is set forth in an instrument signed by\nLandlord. Any such waiver shall not be construed as a waiver of any covenant or condition except\nas to the specific circumstances described in such waiver. Neither Tenant's payment of an amount\nless than a sum due nor Tenant's endorsement or statement on any check or letter accompanying\nsuch payment shall be deemed an accord and satisfaction. Notwithstanding any request or\ndesignation by Tenant, Landlord may apply any payment received from Tenant to any payment\nthen due. Landlord may accept the same without prejudice to Landlord's right to recover the\nbalance of such sum or to pursue other remedies. Re-entry and acceptance of keys shall not be\nconsidered an acceptance of a surrender of this Lease.\n16.5 If Tenant fails to do any act herein required to be made or done by Tenant, then\nLandlord may, but shall not be required to, make such payment or do such act. Landlord's taking\n14\nsuch action shall not be considered a cure of such failure by Tenant nor prevent Landlord from\npursuing any remedy it is otherwise entitled to in connection with such failure. If Landlord elects\nto make such payment or do such act, then all expenses incurred, plus interest thereon at the Default\nRate from the date incurred to the date of payment thereof by Tenant, shall constitute additional\nrent.\n16.6\nIn the event Tenant shall default more than twice during the term hereof by failing\nto pay any Base Rent or additional rent on or before the date due, then, notwithstanding that such\ndefaults shall have each been cured within the applicable grace period, Landlord may at any time\nthereafter require that Base Rent and additional rent due hereunder be paid by certified or bank\ncheck.\n16.7\nIn the event any such default as set forth in paragraphs (c) and (d) of Section 19.1\nabove shall occur with respect to Tenant, Tenant agrees that it will either assume or reject this\nLease within sixty (60) days after the filing of the petition or the commencement of this proceeding\ndescribed in such paragraphs.
