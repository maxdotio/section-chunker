deduction whatsoever, base rent (""Base Rent"") as follows:
a)
Commencing on the Commencement Date, or on such earlier date that
Tenant enters into possession of the Premises for the purpose of conducting its business therein,
Tenant shall pay Base Rent to Landlord the amount of $37,800.00 per year, payable in advance, in
equal monthly installments of $3150. [Commencing on the first day of the second Lease Year
and on the first day of each Lease Year thereafter, the Base Rent shall be increased to an
amount equal to one hundred and three percent (103%) of the Base Rent payable in the
preceding Lease Year and the Base Rent shall continue to be payable in monthly
installments.]
[Delete Section 3.1(b) if the deal does not include renewal options.]
b)
If Tenant exercises its option to renew the term of this Lease, then the annual
Base Rent shall continue to increase as of the first day of each Lease Year of the Renewal Term in
an amount equal to one hundred one hundred and three percent (103%) of the annual Base Rent
payable in the preceding Lease Year and the annual Base Rent shall continue to be payable in
monthly installments in advance.
3.2
On the first day of each and every month during the term of this Lease, Tenant
covenants and agrees to pay to Landlord an amount equal to the sum of the monthly installments
of rent set forth herein plus the monthly installments of additional rent set forth in this Lease.
3.3
Tenant covenants and agrees to pay the rent set forth herein to the Landlord at its
offices described above or at such other place as the Landlord may from time to time designate by
written notice to Tenant. Landlord's acceptance of rent after it shall have become due and payable
shall not excuse a delay upon subsequent occasions nor constitute a waiver of rights,
notwithstanding any endorsement or restriction that Tenant may include with such payment. If
Tenant shall have been late in the payment of any installment of rent or if any payment of rent by
check has been returned for insufficient funds or if tenant otherwise defaults under this Lease,
Landlord may at any time thereafter require that all payments of rent and additional rent due
hereunder be paid by certified check.
3.4
Tenant agrees to pay a ""late charge"" equal to five (5%) per cent of the payment due,
for any payment of rent or additional rent not received by Landlord by the fifth (5th) day of the
4
month due. Such payment and such late fee shall bear interest at the rate of eighteen percent (18%)
per annum (the ""Default Rate"") from the date such payment was due to the date of payment.","SECTION 2
TERM
2.1
The term of this Lease (the ""Lease Term"") shall be ten (10) years [commencing on
July 9, 2018 and, unless sooner terminated, ending on June 30, 2028], and shall commence on
the date that Landlord substantially completes the initial improvements to the Premises to be
provided by Landlord pursuant to Exhibit ""B"" (the ""Commencement Date""); provided, however,
that if the Commencement Date is not the first day of a calendar month, then the Lease Term shall
be ten (10) years plus the partial month in which the Commencement Date occurs. The Lease Term
shall also include any properly exercised renewal or extension of the term of this Lease. Lease
Year shall mean a period of twelve (12) consecutive months commencing on the Lease
Commencement Date (plus the partial month in which the Lease Commencement Date occurs if
the Lease Commencement Date is not the first day of a month) and each successive twelve (12)
month period thereafter.

2.2
The Work shall be deemed to be substantially complete when the work and
materials to be provided by Landlord pursuant to Exhibit B attached hereto (except for items of
work and adjustment of equipment and fixtures that can be completed after the Premises are
occupied without causing substantial interference with Tenant's use of the Premises (i.e., the
""punch list"" items)) have been completed, as determined by Landlord. Notwithstanding the
preceding sentence, if Landlord shall be delayed in completing the work and materials to be
provided pursuant to Exhibit B as a direct or indirect result of (1) Tenant's failure to comply with
any of its duties and obligations hereunder or with any deadlines specified in Exhibit B, (2)
Tenant's request for modifications to plans or working drawings subsequent to the date such plans
or working drawings are approved by Tenant, (3) Tenant's failure to pay when due any amount
required pursuant to Exhibit B, (4) Tenant's request for materials, finishes or installations not
deemed by Landlord to be building standard materials, finishes or installations, (5) any change
orders requested by Tenant, or (6) the performance of any work by any person or firm employed
or retained by Tenant, then for purposes of determining the Lease Commencement Date, the work
and materials to be provided pursuant to Exhibit B shall be deemed to have been substantially
complete on the date that Landlord determines that such work and materials would have been
substantially complete if such delay(s) had not occurred.
2.3
It is presently anticipated that the Premises will be delivered to Tenant within
approximately three (3) from the date of execution of this Lease. If Landlord does not complete
construction and deliver possession of the Premises by such date, then Landlord shall not have any
liability whatsoever, and this Lease shall not be rendered voidable on account thereof.
[Delete Section 2.4 if the deal does not include renewal options.]
2.4
Landlord hereby grants to Tenant the conditional right, exercisable at Tenant's option,
to renew the term of this Lease for () term(s) of ten (10) years. If exercised, and if the conditions
applicable thereto have been satisfied, the Renewal Term ([each, a] the ""Renewal Term"") shall
commence immediately following the end of the then-current Lease Term. The right of renewal
herein granted to Tenant shall be subject to, and shall be exercised in accordance with, the following
terms and conditions:
(a)
Tenant shall exercise its right of renewal with respect to the applicable Renewal Term
by giving Landlord written notice thereof not later than six (6) months prior to the expiration of the
then-current Lease Term ([each, a]the ""Renewal Notice""). During the Renewal Term, all terms and
conditions of this Lease shall remain the same, except that the annual Base Rent payable for the first
Lease Year of the Renewal Term and each Lease Year thereafter shall be as set forth in Section 3.1
below. If Tenant timely and validly exercises its right of renewal, then, at Landlord's option, Landlord
and Tenant shall promptly enter into an amendment to this Lease reflecting the terms described above.
(b)
If the Renewal Notice is not given timely, then Tenant's right of renewal pursuant
to this Section shall lapse and be of no further force of effect.
(c)
If Tenant is in default under this Lease on the date that the Renewal Notice is given
to Landlord or at any time prior to the commencement of the Renewal Term, then, at Landlord's
option, the Renewal Term shall not commence and the term of the Lease shall expire at the
expiration date of the term of this Lease.
3
(d)
If at any time this Lease has been assigned or any portion of the Premises has been
subleased, then Tenant's rights pursuant to this Section shall lapse and be of no further force or
effect.
(e)
Tenant's right of renewal under this Section may be exercised by Tenant only and
may not be exercised by any transferee, sublessee or assignee of Tenant.",0
"suits may be brought to collect any such damages for any month(s), and such suits shall not in any
manner prejudice Landlord's right to collect any such damages for any subsequent month(s), or
Landlord may defer any such suit until after the expiration of the Lease Term, in which event such
suit shall be deemed not to have accrued until the expiration of the Lease Term); or (b) an amount
equal to the present value (as of the date of Tenant's default) of the Base Rent and additional rent
which would have become due through the date on which the Lease Term would have expired but
for Tenant's default, which damages shall be payable to Landlord in a lump sum on demand. For
purpose of this Section, present value shall be computed by discounting at a rate equal to one (1)
whole percentage point above the discount rate then in effect at the Federal Reserve Bank nearest
to the Premises. Whether or not this Lease and/or Tenant's right of possession is terminated,
Landlord shall have the right to terminate by written notice any renewal or expansion right
contained in this Lease and to grant or withhold any consent or approval pursuant to this Lease in
its sole and absolute discretion.
16.3
Tenant hereby covenants and agrees, as a consideration for the granting by
Landlord of this Lease that, in the event of the termination of this Lease by summary proceedings,
or in the event of the entry of a judgment for the recovery of the possession of the Premises in any
action of ejectment, or if Landlord enters by process of law or otherwise, the right of redemption
provided or permitted by any statute, law or decision now or hereafter in force, and the right to
any second and further trial provided or permitted by any statute, law or decision now or hereafter
in force shall be and hereby is expressly waived by Tenant. Further, Tenant, on its own behalf and
for its legal representatives, successors and assigns, and on behalf of all persons or corporations
claiming through or under this Lease, together with creditors of all classes, and all other persons
having an interest therein, does hereby waive, surrender and give up all right or privilege which it
may or might have by reason of Sections 761 and 763 of the Real Property Actions and
Proceedings Law of the State of New York, or by reason of any other present or future law or
decision, to redeem the Premises or have a continuance of this Lease for any part of the term hereof
after having been dispossessed or ejected therefrom by process of law or otherwise.
16.4
Landlord's rights and remedies set forth in this Lease are cumulative and in addition
to Landlord's other rights and remedies at law or in equity, including those available as a result of
any anticipatory breach of this Lease. Landlord's exercise of any such right or remedy shall not
prevent the concurrent or subsequent exercise of any other right or remedy. Landlord's delay or
failure to exercise or enforce any of Landlord's rights or remedies or Tenant's obligations shall not
constitute a waiver of any such rights, remedies or obligations. Landlord shall not be deemed to
have waived any default unless such waiver expressly is set forth in an instrument signed by
Landlord. Any such waiver shall not be construed as a waiver of any covenant or condition except
as to the specific circumstances described in such waiver. Neither Tenant's payment of an amount
less than a sum due nor Tenant's endorsement or statement on any check or letter accompanying
such payment shall be deemed an accord and satisfaction. Notwithstanding any request or
designation by Tenant, Landlord may apply any payment received from Tenant to any payment
then due. Landlord may accept the same without prejudice to Landlord's right to recover the
balance of such sum or to pursue other remedies. Re-entry and acceptance of keys shall not be
considered an acceptance of a surrender of this Lease.
16.5 If Tenant fails to do any act herein required to be made or done by Tenant, then
Landlord may, but shall not be required to, make such payment or do such act. Landlord's taking
14
such action shall not be considered a cure of such failure by Tenant nor prevent Landlord from
pursuing any remedy it is otherwise entitled to in connection with such failure. If Landlord elects
to make such payment or do such act, then all expenses incurred, plus interest thereon at the Default
Rate from the date incurred to the date of payment thereof by Tenant, shall constitute additional
rent.
16.6
In the event Tenant shall default more than twice during the term hereof by failing
to pay any Base Rent or additional rent on or before the date due, then, notwithstanding that such
defaults shall have each been cured within the applicable grace period, Landlord may at any time
thereafter require that Base Rent and additional rent due hereunder be paid by certified or bank
check.
16.7
In the event any such default as set forth in paragraphs (c) and (d) of Section 19.1
above shall occur with respect to Tenant, Tenant agrees that it will either assume or reject this
Lease within sixty (60) days after the filing of the petition or the commencement of this proceeding
described in such paragraphs. In the event this Lease is not assumed within sixty (60) day period,
then Tenant deems this Lease rejected.","c) Tenant or the guarantor of Tenant's obligations hereunder (if any) shall
file a voluntary petition in bankruptcy or shall be adjudicated a bankrupt or insolvent, or
shall file any petition or answer seeking any reorganization, arrangement, composition,
readjustment, liquidation, dissolution or similar relief under the present or any future
federal bankruptcy act or any other present or future applicable federal, state or other
statute of law, or shall seek consent to or acquiesce in the appointment of any trustee,
receiver or liquidator of Tenant or of all or any substantial part of its properties or of the
Premises; or

federal, state or other statute or law, such proceeding shall not have been dismissed, or if,
within sixty (60) days after the appointment, without the consent or acquiescence of
Tenant or any guarantor, of any trustee, receiver or liquidator of Tenant of any guarantor
or of all or any substantial part of its properties or of the Premises, such appointment shall
not have been vacated or stayed on appeal or otherwise, or if, within sixty (60) days after
the expiration of any such stay, such appointment shall not have vacated.
16.2
If there shall be an Event of Default at any time, then the provisions of this Section
shall apply. Landlord shall have the right, at its sole option, to terminate this Lease. In addition,
with or without terminating this Lease, Landlord may re-enter, terminate Tenant's right of
possession and take possession of the Premises. The provisions of this Section shall operate as a
notice to quit, any other notice to quit or of Landlord's intention to re-enter the Premises being
expressly waived. If necessary, Landlord may proceed to recover possession of the Premises under
applicable laws, by such other proceedings, including re-entry and possession, or by using such
force as may be necessary. If Landlord elects to terminate this Lease and/or elects to terminate
Tenant's right of possession, then everything in this Lease to be done by Landlord shall cease,
without prejudice, however, to Tenant's liability for all rent and other sums due hereunder.
Landlord may relet the Premises or any part thereof, alone or together with other premises, for
such term(s) (which may extend beyond the date on which the Lease Term would have expired
but for Tenant's default) and on such terms and conditions (which may include concessions or free
rent and alterations of the Premises) as Landlord, in its sole discretion, may determine, but
Landlord shall not be liable for, nor shall Tenant's obligations be diminished by reason of,
Landlord's failure to relet the Premises or collect any rent due upon such reletting. If Landlord
relets the Premises and collects rent in excess of the Base Rent and additional rent owed by Tenant
hereunder, Landlord shall be entitled to retain any such excess and Tenant shall not be entitled to
a credit therefor. Whether or not this Lease is terminated, Tenant nevertheless shall remain liable
for the Base Rent, additional rent and damages which may be due or sustained, and all costs, fees
and expenses (including without limitation attorneys' fees, brokerage fees and expenses incurred
in placing the Premises in first-class rentable condition) incurred by Landlord in pursuit of its
remedies and in renting the Premises to others from time to time. Tenant shall be liable for all rent
that would have applied to any period of occupancy of the Premises (whether or not any such
period has elapsed) for which Tenant was hereunder granted occupancy without any obligation to
pay such rent (if any). Tenant shall also be liable for additional damages which at Landlord's
election shall be either: (a) an amount equal to the Base Rent and additional rent which would
have become due during the remainder of the Lease Term, less the amount of rental, if any, which
Landlord receives during such period from others to whom the Premises may be rented (other than
any additional rent payable as a result of any failure of such other person to perform any of its
obligations), in which case such damages shall be computed and payable in monthly installments,
in advance, on the first day of each calendar month following Tenant's default and continuing until
the date on which the Lease Term would have expired but for Tenant's default (provided, however,
that if at the time of any reletting of the Premises there exists other space in the Facility available
for Leasing, then the Premises shall be deemed the last space rented, even though the Premises
may be relet prior to the date such other space is leased and provided further, however, that separate
